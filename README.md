# Tensorflow serving with Docker for Model Deployment and build simple gRPC and REST-based APIs

[Compleate Guide and code on Tensorflow serving with Docker for Model Deployment](https://github.com/PritamSonawane7798/Tensorflow_serving/blob/master/TF-Serving-Learner.ipynb)
- This project contain Model training and export TensorFlow models for text classification script, deploy models with TF Serving and Docker in seconds.
- build simple gRPC and REST-based clients in Python for model inference.
